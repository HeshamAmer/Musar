# Musar
This is a graduation project Computer Engineering-Cairo university 2015.
A multi-user secretary and recommender.
It works on application recommending by monitoring your applications and their categories and the time spent on them.
By knowing your friends, Musar is able to detect common interests between you and your friends and hence will recommend new 
trending applications to you.
Musar doesn't only extent to applications, It also has a music recommendation based on the genres of the music on your mobile.
Musar also is your guardian angel, knowing where you go. Musar can send location updates to your family and friends automatically
when travelling alone to a new place.
Musar is a lightweight application that has a lot of features but is currently out of scope of our work.
The project MAY not compile as it was deployed in 2014 on Eclipse.
